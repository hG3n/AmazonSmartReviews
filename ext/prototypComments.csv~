This product worked great and came with everything I needed to repair these unsightly imperfections. I was really worried about getting the color right since my dinning room chairs are a teal color.

I'm upset though because they don't tell you the glue is instant. I mean, as soon as the leather touches the sub-patch once the glue is applied, it bonds and there is no repositioning it. So I have puckered edges to my tear now. Puckered under so its not like I can trim off the edges. Hopefully I can make it look better with the repair compound. But if you get this know that the glue is absolutely instant! This should have made a great repair but because of the glue's properties it now looks pretty bad."

Gives about a 2' x 2' patch of leather along with a patch the same size of a cloth you put underneath.  You use up the cloth with pretty much one small hole (needing at least 1/2' overlap in each direction.  You cut the leather to fit the hole & thus can possibly use it on numerous holes with another generic piece of cloth (I haven't tried tho). The hardest part is mixing the paint to match.  They have instructions for basic colors (ex: tan), but to get it to be the color you want is not for the faint of heart.  They might say, mix orange, yellow, white and brown.  Add more brown if this, add more yellow if this.  I sort of wish they'd show shades and give ratios to mix."

You can still tell it's a repair if you look, but it's not noticeable at all. The color mix directions are easy enough, the tricky part was cutting/shaping and installing the sub-patch. Tip: with the light sanding, stay within 1/4' to 1/2' from the tear. Any further will be mard to mask with the filler and could end up having noticeably less sheen that the repaired area and original leather. Overall great product."

I got a bid of $150 to get fixed professionally, and just thought I could save some money and do it myself.Some hints:-Put it on in several thin coats- I was able to get a pretty close match in color (as the directions state make it a wee bit lighter because it gets darker when it dries- don't sweat this though, if you don't have the color right, you can get it right with your second coat.)-Be careful with the sand paper- this is really what made a smallish area into a bigger repair then it needed to be.  Directions state to sand around the area- this removes the color of the leather requiring you to creep out further then you would like to.The rip is sealed now, and I have no doubt that it is sealed for good.  I can still see the line of the rip through the repair and kind of a clumpy hard rubbery patch sitting on top of it now.  I really am a glass half full kind of gal, but hindsight leaves me wishing that I had spent the $150 on a professional repair.  It is what it is."

It's against the manufacturer.Don't waste your money on this product if you have a leather couch with a couple of fine tears in it. That's what I have and this was a waste of money. I would imagine it would work better if you had some outright holes in a leather couch, bigger than what I have. The patching pieces (sub-material and the leather) were just too big to fit into the holes I have.So now I'm just using the glue to see if I can glue the rips shut.Unfortunately, I really thought this would be a better product, based on the price compared to other similar products."

I spent good money on them originally, and I hated to have to go shopping to try to replace them. The issue is the wear and tear my dog (yellow lab) and my cat (siamese) have caused in the last 4 years. Leather is great with pets because it cleans so easily, but the pet claws eventually wear grooves into the leather.This stuff fills them in like plastic wood does for wood. The color matching is the hard part, but with patience I got a perfect match. I applied it with a makeup brush (eyeshadow brush to be exact) and then I dabbed off the excess with my fingertip. That set it with a natural dull texture like the original finish. The stuff dries quickly and came off my hands like a second skin peeling off, no mess whatsoever. I've done the ottoman so far with fantastic results, the repairs are almost invisible. I'll take before and after pictures of the couch and chair and add them to this review soon.Great product! This is going to save my furniture ;-)"

Matching the exact 'red' of the booth seemed easy enough, however, when I came back to work on it again, the color didn't match as well as it seemed originally.  Also, use the sandpaper very sparingly.  I think the repair would have looked more inconspicuous had I not used the sandpaper at all.  In Leather Magic's defense....I have little patience for this kind of thing and it probably takes more time to really get it right."

They are black, so I didn't have to worry about color mixing. The first thing to go wrong was the finish on the product after it dried. It was very shiny, like patent leather. So my barstools looked like they had tone-on-tone polka dots! The second thing to go wrong was when I cleaned off the stools several days later during my routine housework. Using a normal, soft dishcloth, wet and well wrong out, no cleaning product on it at all, just plain water, I lightly wiped off my barstools, and there went my new shiny polkadots. All the leather repair rubbed right off like thin plastic. The best thing I can say is that the claw marks are still there and I am right back where I started. The worst thing I can say is I wasted my money on this product. I definitely wouldn't recomend it for a fine piece of leather furniture!"

I wouldn't expect the repair to be completely unnoticeable. Using that standard, I've given this five stars.Positives:*The instructions are EXCELLENT, particularly the very detailed color mixing instructions.*Plenty of colors of compound are provided, ensuring that the correct color can be mixed. Also I will be able to use this kit again if necessary (though I'll need to provide my own patch next time.)*The materials are easy to work with if directions are followed.Now, this doesn't look perfect on my leather chair. We had a large rip (about 4 inches.) I can see where the rip is. But our chair is a burgundy textured leather. Neither the color nor the texture is uniform, so there would be no way to use a kit like this and have the repair compound blend perfectly with the leather. But it looks pretty good, certainly way better than a rip. It's not immediately noticeable if you're not looking for it.For the price (I paid about $25), this is a fantastic way to repair leather at home.I've uploaded some photos of the repair."

We had a 2' tear in our dark brown leather couch which looked bad and also concerned us that it would only get worse.  Initial estimates to repair it professionally were looking at $200-400 in our area so now I am looking at do I just replace the couch.  I went ahead with buying this product knowing that it could only get worse but was very happy with the end result.  The mending went very well and the color fill blended in nearly perfect.  The work is not prefect though.  We can tell where the tear was and my skills at mending and filling are meek but if you did not know that there was a tear there before, 95% would never know.  I also repaired my Mountaineer leather seat which had a 3' cut.  Again the mend went well but the color on the light grey was harder to match.

I rarely leave feedback for products, but I felt I needed to since I was almost dissuaded from purchasing it because of the inconsistent reviews. I just completed repairing the tear--which was about 1.5 inches long and went all the way through the leather--and it looks SO much better than I had anticipated. I have the dark brown leather Kramfors sofa from Ikea and no one would be able to tell there was a tear unless they knew exactly where to look, and even then they might not notice. I was able to mix the tinted filler compound to match the sofa exactly, but this might be a bit trickier for those with light or unusually colored fabrics; I think it could be done well, but it would take more time and patience when mixing the compound. I was also lucky in that the leather in the sofa has a grain, so it makes any imperfections leftover from the repair kit (or my application thereof) less noticeable.Overall, I am extremely pleased with the Leather Magic kit and highly recommend it.

My sofa and loveseat from 'Garbage-To-Go' had two tears in the leather just one year after purchase. This was caused by the leather being so thin and defective in places. Called a leather repair company, who quoted $150-$200 for the repair but wouldn't even guarantee the repair because the tear was in the seat cushion. Why bother then?  Ordered this kit as a last resort and figured I didnt have  anything to lose.  Repairing the leather does takes a little time, but with this kit the repair is done the proper way, i.e. with a subpatch under the tear giving it more strength. I was fortunate in that I didnt have to mix the color compound because the brown color just happened to match my couch perfectly. However, I would have felt comfortable mixing the colors if neccessary and the company even offers another kit where they will custom mix colors for you. I called Leather Magic twice for advice and they were really helpful. So far, its been two weeks and I am very happy with the results. My repair is not that noticeable because my leather is dark brown, but you need to have realistic expectations and realise that leather repairs are not going to be invisible. My goal was to get a few more years from these leather couches that cost me $3,000 and so far I'm pleased with the results from this little $25.00 kit.UPDATE.....(Nov 2010) Its now 18 months later and the original repair patch is still going strong!

It isn't pretty--It still looks like I tried to cover a rip but at least it's not that big of an eyesore anymore."
