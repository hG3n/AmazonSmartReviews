This product worked great and came with everything I needed to repair these unsightly imperfections. I was really worried about getting the color right since my dinning room chairs are a teal color.

I'm upset though because they don't tell you the glue is instant. I mean, as soon as the leather touches the sub-patch once the glue is applied, it bonds and there is no repositioning it. So I have puckered edges to my tear now. Puckered under so its not like I can trim off the edges. Hopefully I can make it look better with the repair compound. But if you get this know that the glue is absolutely instant! This should have made a great repair but because of the glue's properties it now looks pretty bad."

Gives about a 2' x 2' patch of leather along with a patch the same size of a cloth you put underneath.  You use up the cloth with pretty much one small hole (needing at least 1/2' overlap in each direction.  You cut the leather to fit the hole & thus can possibly use it on numerous holes with another generic piece of cloth (I haven't tried tho). The hardest part is mixing the paint to match.  They have instructions for basic colors (ex: tan), but to get it to be the color you want is not for the faint of heart.  They might say, mix orange, yellow, white and brown.  Add more brown if this, add more yellow if this.  I sort of wish they'd show shades and give ratios to mix."

You can still tell it's a repair if you look, but it's not noticeable at all. The color mix directions are easy enough, the tricky part was cutting/shaping and installing the sub-patch. Tip: with the light sanding, stay within 1/4' to 1/2' from the tear. Any further will be mard to mask with the filler and could end up having noticeably less sheen that the repaired area and original leather. Overall great product."

I got a bid of $150 to get fixed professionally, and just thought I could save some money and do it myself.Some hints:-Put it on in several thin coats- I was able to get a pretty close match in color (as the directions state make it a wee bit lighter because it gets darker when it dries- don't sweat this though, if you don't have the color right, you can get it right with your second coat.)-Be careful with the sand paper- this is really what made a smallish area into a bigger repair then it needed to be.  Directions state to sand around the area- this removes the color of the leather requiring you to creep out further then you would like to.The rip is sealed now, and I have no doubt that it is sealed for good.  I can still see the line of the rip through the repair and kind of a clumpy hard rubbery patch sitting on top of it now.  I really am a glass half full kind of gal, but hindsight leaves me wishing that I had spent the $150 on a professional repair.  It is what it is."

It's against the manufacturer.Don't waste your money on this product if you have a leather couch with a couple of fine tears in it. That's what I have and this was a waste of money. I would imagine it would work better if you had some outright holes in a leather couch, bigger than what I have. The patching pieces (sub-material and the leather) were just too big to fit into the holes I have.So now I'm just using the glue to see if I can glue the rips shut.Unfortunately, I really thought this would be a better product, based on the price compared to other similar products."

I spent good money on them originally, and I hated to have to go shopping to try to replace them. The issue is the wear and tear my dog (yellow lab) and my cat (siamese) have caused in the last 4 years. Leather is great with pets because it cleans so easily, but the pet claws eventually wear grooves into the leather.This stuff fills them in like plastic wood does for wood. The color matching is the hard part, but with patience I got a perfect match. I applied it with a makeup brush (eyeshadow brush to be exact) and then I dabbed off the excess with my fingertip. That set it with a natural dull texture like the original finish. The stuff dries quickly and came off my hands like a second skin peeling off, no mess whatsoever. I've done the ottoman so far with fantastic results, the repairs are almost invisible. I'll take before and after pictures of the couch and chair and add them to this review soon.Great product! This is going to save my furniture ;-)"

Matching the exact 'red' of the booth seemed easy enough, however, when I came back to work on it again, the color didn't match as well as it seemed originally.  Also, use the sandpaper very sparingly.  I think the repair would have looked more inconspicuous had I not used the sandpaper at all.  In Leather Magic's defense....I have little patience for this kind of thing and it probably takes more time to really get it right."

They are black, so I didn't have to worry about color mixing. The first thing to go wrong was the finish on the product after it dried. It was very shiny, like patent leather. So my barstools looked like they had tone-on-tone polka dots! The second thing to go wrong was when I cleaned off the stools several days later during my routine housework. Using a normal, soft dishcloth, wet and well wrong out, no cleaning product on it at all, just plain water, I lightly wiped off my barstools, and there went my new shiny polkadots. All the leather repair rubbed right off like thin plastic. The best thing I can say is that the claw marks are still there and I am right back where I started. The worst thing I can say is I wasted my money on this product. I definitely wouldn't recomend it for a fine piece of leather furniture!"

I wouldn't expect the repair to be completely unnoticeable. Using that standard, I've given this five stars.Positives:*The instructions are EXCELLENT, particularly the very detailed color mixing instructions.*Plenty of colors of compound are provided, ensuring that the correct color can be mixed. Also I will be able to use this kit again if necessary (though I'll need to provide my own patch next time.)*The materials are easy to work with if directions are followed.Now, this doesn't look perfect on my leather chair. We had a large rip (about 4 inches.) I can see where the rip is. But our chair is a burgundy textured leather. Neither the color nor the texture is uniform, so there would be no way to use a kit like this and have the repair compound blend perfectly with the leather. But it looks pretty good, certainly way better than a rip. It's not immediately noticeable if you're not looking for it.For the price (I paid about $25), this is a fantastic way to repair leather at home.I've uploaded some photos of the repair."

We had a 2' tear in our dark brown leather couch which looked bad and also concerned us that it would only get worse.  Initial estimates to repair it professionally were looking at $200-400 in our area so now I am looking at do I just replace the couch.  I went ahead with buying this product knowing that it could only get worse but was very happy with the end result.  The mending went very well and the color fill blended in nearly perfect.  The work is not prefect though.  We can tell where the tear was and my skills at mending and filling are meek but if you did not know that there was a tear there before, 95% would never know.  I also repaired my Mountaineer leather seat which had a 3' cut.  Again the mend went well but the color on the light grey was harder to match.

I rarely leave feedback for products, but I felt I needed to since I was almost dissuaded from purchasing it because of the inconsistent reviews. I just completed repairing the tear--which was about 1.5 inches long and went all the way through the leather--and it looks SO much better than I had anticipated. I have the dark brown leather Kramfors sofa from Ikea and no one would be able to tell there was a tear unless they knew exactly where to look, and even then they might not notice. I was able to mix the tinted filler compound to match the sofa exactly, but this might be a bit trickier for those with light or unusually colored fabrics; I think it could be done well, but it would take more time and patience when mixing the compound. I was also lucky in that the leather in the sofa has a grain, so it makes any imperfections leftover from the repair kit (or my application thereof) less noticeable.Overall, I am extremely pleased with the Leather Magic kit and highly recommend it.

My sofa and loveseat from 'Garbage-To-Go' had two tears in the leather just one year after purchase. This was caused by the leather being so thin and defective in places. Called a leather repair company, who quoted $150-$200 for the repair but wouldn't even guarantee the repair because the tear was in the seat cushion. Why bother then?  Ordered this kit as a last resort and figured I didnt have  anything to lose.  Repairing the leather does takes a little time, but with this kit the repair is done the proper way, i.e. with a subpatch under the tear giving it more strength. I was fortunate in that I didnt have to mix the color compound because the brown color just happened to match my couch perfectly. However, I would have felt comfortable mixing the colors if neccessary and the company even offers another kit where they will custom mix colors for you. I called Leather Magic twice for advice and they were really helpful. So far, its been two weeks and I am very happy with the results. My repair is not that noticeable because my leather is dark brown, but you need to have realistic expectations and realise that leather repairs are not going to be invisible. My goal was to get a few more years from these leather couches that cost me $3,000 and so far I'm pleased with the results from this little $25.00 kit.UPDATE.....(Nov 2010) Its now 18 months later and the original repair patch is still going strong!

Get a professional. But if you've just an average-priced or bicast couch this product is perfect. If you can get your colors right you will be pretty pleased. I spent some time mixing colors and everyone has been impressed with the results. Most have to really search and feel around to find the tear. It was originally about a 1 1/2 inch tear in a bicast leather couch and it was growing daily. If you have a rip in a bicast couch you need to stop it asap because it *will* keep ripping. Also, I put on about 4-5 layers of the goo over a 3 day period and it's held amazingly strong. It might even be stronger than it was before. Great product, a little pricey, but it's better than a nasty tear.As a side note, if you can send in a sample of your leather to Leather Magic, they will magic the color for you."

Works pretty much as advertised. Will repair small tears. It does take some time, several light layers, to make a good repair, but the end result is good. Toughest thing is color matching, but the included color guide is helpful. The first repair I did (same spot) held up for 2-3 years (sitting directly on it daily). I'm hoping I did a better job this time, and it will hold up for a few years. A lot cheaper than the alternative (new sofa)."

I agree with other reviews that you have to have 'realistic expectations'.  That means, you may not be able to get it so perfectly patched that somebody cleaning it could not tell, but boy you can get close.  If you have ever painted a car (I have not) then I bet you could do even better than me.  I patched a 3 3-5 inch cuts on a colored leather cushion and I was able to match the color almost exactly on the second try.  Also, I would recommend doing one spot first, not all of them at once if you have more than one.  After the first one you learn some things.  Use soft leather backing as a patch instead of they include in this kit ..at least this is what  a pro told me to do.  I have no complaints with this kit and am actually suprised how good I was able to get the repair.  If the spot looks 'like rubber' as one review said, you put too much on at once and you may want to use an old tshirt or something to dab and help add realistic looking texture.  Great product for $25! Probably even for $75!"

I took it to a leather shop here in LA and they quoted me $75 to repair it (mostly labor no doubt).  On the advice of a co-worker, I figured I'd give this kit a try before popping for that much.  The tear's location was another big factor in my decision give this kit a try since it's only visible to people behind me who look down (which I would question anyway...)I received the kit, followed the simple instructions, and 30 minutes later voila! no more tear!  It's not invisible by any means, but since my jacket is black with a slightly faded appearance/finish, the kit's black coloring blended in perfectly with the leather's appearance and color.  And although the kit includes several colors and instructions how to blend them to achieve the desired color, I was fortunate that I only had to tone down the black coloring to account for the faded look of the leather.  If the user needs a color other than black then your mileage may vary..."

If you follow the instructions, work in layers, and take a bit of care you'll be very happy with the outcome.The included color mixing palette is not very helpful, looks like it was printed on a color laser printer and the colors don't match reality. Even so, by first mixing brown (1/3 black, 1/3 red, 1/3 yellow) and then darkening the mix with black again, I got a near perfect match for my dark brown couch from the 1st attempt.As the title says this kit is great from small jobs (1-3 sq. inches), if your project is, lets say, brown you'll have enough for about 10 sq inches.Unless you need to fix multiple items of varying colors this is not a very cost effective solution, since you'll end up with lots of unused paint in colors you won't need.Tip: get a bottle of leather conditioner while you're at it. You will be sanding (kit includes small, but adequate sliver) and you will need some leather conditioner once you're done to restore luster to the leather."

After a lot of research, I ordered this one and I couldn't be more pleased (and relieved!!)My large dog tore an expensive leather bench with his hind claw--about a 3 inch tear with fraying.  It was pretty bad...  At first glance it looks complicated to figure out the paint mixing and all of the steps.  But after beginning the process, I realized it was super simple!  You just have to be sure to follow each step to the letter, take your time, and be patient.You begin by placing a little cloth in to the tear and gluing it together.  The mix the paint--which is really a compound that dries quickly into a leather-type filler material.  The kit includes an empty dish to mix your colors in, and keep the compound moist between coats or if you have to walk away from the project for awhile.I wound up doing about 8 coats, so the first few were perfect for simply filling in the huge tear and finding out the right color mix. I used a hair dryer in between coats so the whole project went quickly.My only advice would be this--don't sand a huge area--just sand the immediate area because whatever you sand, you will have to cover with compound.My bench looks perfect!  You can tell that it was repaired, but there is no more tear and if you were not looking for the patched area, you wouldn't see it right away.  I LOOOOOOOVE this product!!!!  Don't be afraid to try it-it seriously can save a piece of furniture!!!"

They are very brief and didnt have any clue how to properly put in the last step; which is the gloss. Then there's the different colors that was on a tub that looked like no more than 1 and one half of table spoon each.  Well, I mixed the color as instructed at the color guide and fine tuned the color on to my practice leather; I did the first 2 steps of on the instructions and when I spread the compound on the leather, it's too glossy and shiny, also if the colors are not 100% matched (which most likely you couldn't)it will look like a shiny middle with streaks on the outline as you fill in the fine wrinkles of the leather and shave the protruding parts. There's no way you to copy the texture of the leather around the repaired area unless the you plan to cover the whole pannel, which is again not possible since you only have a little more than a table spoon of paint!Negatives: -expensive -hard to use -limited instructions on the kit -repair will obviously look amateur-ish -Not so leather magicPositives: -It's one thing you could put on your 'NEVER buy list.'Do yourself a favor and never bother with this product; saves you the headache."
